--- Manual tests for the UART ---
Since Unity is depending on the UART functions, the only possibility to test
the UART API when not running the Unity framework.

--- Send and receive a character in loopback mode -------
Test of the API has been performed by sending/receiving a character with the
existing functions:
	void uart_init(const uart_settings_t *);
	uint8_t uart_tx_ready(void);
	uint8_t uart_rx_ready(void);
	void uart_write_char(uint8_t);
	char uart_read_char(void);

If these two conditions are satisfied, then the internal LED is turned on:
	1) Send 'A', receive 'A'
	2) Send 'A', don't receive 'B'

Code:
const uart_settings_t uart_settings = {
	.baud_rate = 115200,
	.parity = UART_PARITY_NO,
	.ch_mode = UART_CHMODE_LOCAL_LOOPBACK
};
uart_init(&uart_settings);


pio_conf_pin(PIO_PORTB,27,1,0); // Turn LED on if success
}else{
pio_conf_pin(PIO_PORTB, 27,0,0); // Turn LED off if unsuccessful
}
