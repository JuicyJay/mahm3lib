------ Manual tests for the UART ------

Test of the API has been performed by sending/receiving characters with the existing functions:
uint8_t uart_init(const uart_settings_t *);
uint8_t uart_tx_ready(void);
uint8_t uart_rx_ready(void);
void uart_write_chr(uint8_t);
void uart_write_str(char *);
char uart_read_chr(void);

Important!
The function "uint8_t uart_init(const uart_settings_t *)" doesn't perform any control of the input parameter.
This must be implemented in future versions!
