---- Manual tests for the Watchdog API ----

---- void wdt_disable(void)
-Description:
The Watchdog Timer API is currently very limited. There's only a function for disabling the Watchdog timer, which must be done during system initialization. Otherwise the system will restart after 16 seconds. This is described in the datasheet:
	"The Watchdog Timer can be used to prevent system lock-up if the software becomes trapped in	a deadlock.
	It features a 12-bit down counter that allows a watchdog period of up to 16 seconds (slow clock at 32.768 kHz)."
-Test method:
1) The only way to test if "void wdt_disable(void)" does it's job is to wait and see if the system doesn't restart when the function is called.
2) The opposite is tested by not calling the function. Then the system shall restart!
-Result from test:
1) OK!
2) OK!
